    <div class="box"><h2>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."</h2></div>

    <div class="box"><h2>I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.</h2></div>
    <div class="box"><h2>I have a dream today!</div>
    <div class="box"><h2>........Free at last! Free at last!

        Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"</h2></div>
